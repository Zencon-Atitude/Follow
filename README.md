Follow the Lead is founded by Pedro Vannini, an experienced trader and financial analyst, along with a talented interdisciplinary team comprising Marlon Reis, our Web3 developer, Rafael Massiah, a Backend expert, and a Frontend, UX, and Marketing specialist - Lilian Perman. Our goal is to revolutionize the way people approach investing, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to empower both novice and expert traders.

## Our solution:

Follow the Lead offers a multifaceted solution to address the challenges faced by investors:

### *Operational Tools*

Our real-time interface provides users with a visual representation of their chosen strategy in action. Candle colors and pop-up notifications offer valuable insights, guiding users with suggestions on when to buy and sell assets effectively.

### *Marketplace*

In our Marketplace, users can explore and subscribe to additional trading methods. Professional traders can monetize their expertise by selling subscriptions to their own strategies. A robust ranking system ensures that the best-performing strategies receive the recognition they deserve.

### *Community*

Our vibrant community fosters collaboration and learning. Experienced users can share articles and information to educate others, creating a supportive ecosystem where beginners evolve into advanced traders.

## *Why Web3?*
